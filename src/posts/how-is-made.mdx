You can see the code [here](https://github.com/abluetuba/tuba-site).

This simple website is made with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). At the time of writing this is still in its early phase so I will probably make more specific blog posts in the future.

I'm writing these posts in markdown: Gatsby generates the pages with the help of [gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/). This is the first time I'm using this, so I don't know if I will stick with it.

I chose [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for the style. I used this package in other projects and I like that you can write normal CSS scoped easily to the components.

The whole thing is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
